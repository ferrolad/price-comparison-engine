  <p class="from" align="left">Then, if you know what you want, you can use the search engine. This will search all the products on Hi5Brands and return the matches in a list grouped by category.</p>
  <p class="from" align="left">Or, you can use the menu on the homepage to look through the different categories. If you can't find the category you want in this area, you may be able to find it from within another category. For example, if you want to find widescreen televisions, choose televisions and then you will see a link to 'widescreen televisions'. See the 'How do I navigate through the category menus' page for more help.</p>

This list will include all the prices that we have matched against retailers we have searched, not just those who advertise with us. This means there is a much wider range of prices, and you are more likely to find the cheapest price out there.</p>
  <p class="from" align="left">We also encourage all our users to review retailers of whom they have experience. This helps you to find a retailer you can trust. We never adjust these scores manually, and do our best to ensure that the reviews you see reflect true experiences.</p>

Retailers who advertise with us receive an 'enhanced listing' so that you can go straight to the offer, making it even easier for you to save money.</p>
  <p align="left" class="from">Shopping Safely Online</p>
  <p align="left" class="from">Shopping online is usually cheaper, more convenient and should be just as safe to shopping on the high street. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure you have a safe online shopping experience.</p>
  <p align="left" class="from">Choose a reputable retailer</p>
  <p class="mid_cata" align="left">If you haven't heard of a retailer before, there are a number of tools to help  you choose the right one: </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="from">Look out for the R Logo in the price listings.</li>
    <li class="from">Read reviews to find out what other consumers thought of their service.</li>
    <li class="from">Read posts in our <span class="cata_txt"><a href="http://hifibrands.com/wp/">forum</a></span></li>
  </ul>
  
    <p class="from" align="left">Look for contact details</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Some online retailers do not provide sufficient contact details about themselves. Never buy from anyone who only has an email address listed. Make sure you print and save a telephone number and postal address.</p>
    <p align="left" class="from">Check delivery times</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Check the delivery dates before you place your order to make sure your product will arrive in time.</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Check total costs</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Make sure you check the total costs when ordering online - often delivery is charged on top of the initial price listed.</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Check the returns policy</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Check the retailer's returns policy to find out what you need to do if the goods arrive faulty.</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Look for the padlock icon</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Always make sure that the internet connection is secure when you're providing personal and payment information. You will see a little padlock icon at the bottom of your web browser and often websites will tell you that you're entering a secure area of the  site.</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Pay by credit card, not a debit card for internet purchases</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Paying by credit card will give you extra protection for anything you buy over the value of $100.00. So in case your product arrives damagedor you have problems, your credit card company will help you rectify the problem.</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Print and save confirmation documents</p>
    <p class="from" align="left">Once you have made an online purchase, you will receive a confirmation order number or email. It is important that you print and save this information in case you need to chase up the order.</p>
    <p align="right" class="mid_cata">Know your rights</p>
    <p align="center" class="cata_txt">When you buy online, you have exactly the same rights as in a high street shop.</p>
